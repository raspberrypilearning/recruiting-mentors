## How to develop role descriptions

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

People are much more likely to respond positively to a request to do specific tasks rather than fill a role where they are unsure of what is required of them. Mentor role descriptions outline what a role involves. They ensure both the volunteer and others in the club have a clear understanding of the tasks they will be expected to do.

**Role descriptions usually include:**
+ Role title 
+ Aims and expectations of the role
+ An outline of the role's tasks
+ Location, timing, and regularity of sessions (i.e. how long and where you need the mentors to be present)

Descriptions can also include why a new mentor might like to take up the opportunity, how the role fits within the Code Club, expectations of behaviour, as well as desirable skills and qualifications.

## Example role descriptions
Below are four different example volunteer role descriptions that you can adapt to suit the needs of your club.
  
The role descriptions are not exclusive or exhaustive. Many mentors will have a primary role, but will help out in other areas of the club and with other tasks as required.
