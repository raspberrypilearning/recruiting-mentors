## Resources to help you promote

Linked below are some useful resources you can use and adapt to help promote mentor opportunities for your club. They are organised according to the approach you decide to use to reach out to potential volunteers. Communications should include: 
+ Key tasks mentors will support with
+ When they will be needed
+ A clear call to action (what people should do if they are interested)

Some people may have youth work or technical skills you want in your Dojo, others can help with Dojo admin tasks to help free up technical mentors. Even if the person you're talking to is not able to mentor at the Dojo themselves, it’s a great way to spread the word: are there people with the skills you need at their places of work?
