How people respond will depend on the approach you have chosen to promote your mentor opportunities.
  
--- task ---
  
**Decide** how you want interested people to follow up about the opportunity. Make sure this is easy for those who hear about it.
  
--- /task ---
 
You might ask those who see a poster or a newspaper advertisement to **email** the Code Club's email address if they are interested.
  
You could suggest those who see a social media post about it, to **comment** on the post or **directly message** you on that channel.
  
If you are talking to someone you know, you might give them your mobile number to **call you back** once they have thought about it. 
  
If you are posting about mentoring online, you might provide a link to an **online form** (e.g. Google form) for potential mentors to fill out.

**Respond quickly and politely** to ensure that the first impression of your Code Club is a positive one.

--- task ---

**Share** more detailed information about the Code Club, and answer any questions they have about the role. 
  
--- /task ---
  
This will help people to decide on whether the role is a good fit for them or not. The role description you developed earlier should help with this.

--- task ---

**Invite them to visit your club** so that they can find out more and so you can get to know them too. Alternatively, you could arrange to meet them in a public place.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Remember:** Visitors who haven’t obtained a background check should be accompanied by a vetted volunteer at all times and not be left unattended with young people. 
</p>
  
Not every response leads to a new volunteer joining your club, and that’s okay! When this happens, firstly, thank people for their interest, but also use it as an opportunity to get feedback around why the role may not have been a good fit.
This feedback may help you to consider:

+ Any alternative roles for the individual
+ Tweaking or clarifying your role description to improve future recruitment
+ Flexibility. Is there a way that you could accommodate specific needs?
