## Promote
There are three key elements to consider when promoting volunteer opportunities: who, where, and how.


## Who to recruit

Code Clubs told us that they recruit:
+ Parents of young people who participate in the club
+ Venue staff (e.g. librarians, office staff, youth workers)
+ Volunteer or STEM organisations in the region
+ IT professionals working in the area
+ Local tech or education community and social group members
+ Students (secondary or further education)
+ Local educators (primary, secondary, or further education)
+ Teenagers who participated in the Code Club and evolved into mentors
+ Retirees previously involved in education or technology

**Look** through the list of 'who to recruit'. Are there any other groups of people in your area you could recruit volunteers from that aren't included in this list?

**Write down** the groups of people who might be available, or interested in volunteer opportunities in your club.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Focus on speaking to people connected to and passionate about the club first. Ask them if they know someone else who would be interested. If needed, you can then reach out to the wider community. </p>
  
## Where to promote

Where will you need to advertise your opportunity to reach potential volunteers?

In the UK, platforms such as [Doit](https://www.doit.life/){:target="_blank"} and [Reach Volunteering](https://reachvolunteering.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} allow organisations to advertise volunteer roles and reach people looking to share their time and skills. The [National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO)](https://ncvo.org.uk/#/){:target="_blank"} also provides guidance on recruiting and welcoming volunteers.

In Ireland, [Volunteer Ireland](https://www.volunteer.ie/){:target="_blank"} supports organisations through local volunteer centres and its national volunteering platform, i-VOL, which helps match volunteers with opportunities in their area.

**Think** about the key places and platforms that the people you want to reach, visit and use.

## How to promote
+ Talk to people directly
+ Social media posts
+ Direct email
+ Placing posters in key places
+ Newspaper articles
+ Radio interviews
+ Presentations or visits to local companies
+ Host an information session for prospective volunteers
+ Current volunteers, parents, sponsors, or venue staff asked to recruit others

**Review** the 'How to promote' list. Which of these approaches would be most impactful in your local area? What approach would you prefer to try? Are there other ways you could reach potential volunteers in your local area not mentioned on this list?

--- /task ---
  
--- task ---

**Write down** three approaches you will use to recruit those you selected from the 'who to recruit' list.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**A direct and personal invitation is often more successful.** Reach out to those you know, or have a colleague or friend introduce you to someone they think would be interested in the opportunity. Personalise emails where possible.
