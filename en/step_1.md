## Introduction

This course will support those involved in managing and running a Code Club to recruit volunteer mentors. Once completed, you should:
- Understand what tasks mentors can help with

## Reflect on your clubs needs

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Code Clubs benefit from having volunteers with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences.
</p>

Your club might need mentors to help with:
+ Setting up the space and computers
+ Talking to young people to guide them to find solutions for themselves
+ Gathering suitable learning resources and projects
+ Organising snacks and refreshments for longer sessions
+ Fundraising or organising events
+ Technical support for more complex coding languages

## How many mentors do I need?
The number of mentors will depend on how many young people attend your sessions, and the type of activities you are doing. Hands-on activities such as physical computing may require more volunteer support.

  <span style="color: #0faeb0">We recommend a ratio of **one mentor to every eight children**.</p>

Before discussing a volunteer opportunity with someone, it can be useful to have an outline of what you want the mentor to do, and the benefits of mentoring in mind. Developing a **role description** can be useful for this.
